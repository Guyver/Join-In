Once Sandra has the data from the user we need to store it somewhere for our use.
To achieve this we developed a local server that can be access via websocket connection.
Then we can connect via web sockets from our local application to retrieve the data.
In Join-In's case we are connecting from javascript as its a browser application so we decided to go with a Nodejs server
and socketIO for connection.

Ideally this server should be running before you log onto the game to prevent reconnecting issues.
Once you log on and connect to the sandra server from the browser you can then start SANDRA via the batch file.

So in bullet point form the instructions are:

1) Run the sandra server in the cmd.
2) Connect to the game server and begin the game.
3) Run the Sandra batch file.
