Changes:

Deleted mesh in joint class and tidied it so it uses it stand alone position instead of the mesh position. 								//1hr
Deleted mesh in player class and tidied it so it uses its stand alone position instead of mesh position.								//2hr
Deleled functions in the collision manager class and changed it to use the position of the joints and not meshes in the scene. 			//2hr

Todo:

Fix collision to work with player position and not a player mesh in the scene... or redo the meshes if bounding sphere is needed. 		// Est 2hr
Fix the mesh loading to be done in the main to resolve the scope problems.																// Est 5hr
Copy one set of players models and use them to create others instead of duplicate loading.												// Est 2hr.


Ideas:

Create all of the levels on the one scene so the loading is in one html page and uses one set of code.
Use another canvas for tutorials.
Use another canvas for loading the next level.
Walking to use dt to make it acurate.
Walking speed increased
Rotation speed to use dt
Rotation code decreased
better trees.
