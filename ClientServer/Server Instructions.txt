The game server is a NodeJS server. The game server also depends on a mongo, noSql, database.

1) Run the mongo server ( mongod )
2) Run the Server

Each client then connects and has to enter a unique id to log on which the server then retrieves the data associated to that key.
It then creates a player map and stores it globally in the server and associates them by their clients ip addresses.
It also keeps a store of the connected clients sockets so it can transmit to any client as needed.
