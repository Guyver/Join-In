 * Allows to use the WiiUseJ and GeeWee IR event detection functions.
 * There are several functions that we don not need but we have to keep in the code because this class implements an interface which has those functions.
 * In this class, it is implemented both WiiGee and WiiUseJ listener interfaces that allow to use this class as a facade to the IRGlance class. If you want to use a new package of drivers to manage the IR system, you will have to
 * code the correct function body so that it calls to IRSpotGlanced with the number of IR points that the WiiMote has detected.
